📊 **Overview**

This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard built to analyze and monitor bank loan performance data.
It delivers comprehensive insights into loan applications, funding, repayments, borrower behavior, and portfolio quality using real-time metrics.

The dashboard provides clarity on Good vs Bad Loans, state-wise loan distribution, purpose-based trends, and month-over-month performance — helping financial teams make data-driven lending decisions.

🎯 **Objective**

The main goal of this project is to:

Evaluate loan portfolio health across multiple dimensions.

Track key KPIs such as funded amount, received amount, DTI, and interest rate.

Identify trends, risk areas, and growth opportunities.

Provide interactive filters for better segmentation (by state, purpose, loan grade, etc.).

Enable data-driven lending and recovery strategies.
